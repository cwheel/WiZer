# WiZer

The wireless in our residence hall is often plagued by rouge devices like wireless printers, Chromecasts, personal hotspots and other interfering devices. Even worse, areas of our building have a poor wireless signal overall regardless of the areas devices. We've spent a great number of hours roaming our hall with laptops and phones, staring at ugly text based tables searching for devices and checking signal strength. We wanted to deploy devices that could do the job we coulden't; to monitor the hall and its networks (or any area for that matter) 24/7 and look through the data at our leisure.
