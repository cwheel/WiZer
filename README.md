# WiZer
**WiZer was selected as a finalist project at HackUMass!**

The wireless in our residence hall is often plagued by rouge devices like wireless printers, Chromecasts, personal hotspots and other interfering devices. Even worse, areas of our building have a poor wireless signal overall regardless of the areas devices. We've spent a great number of hours roaming our hall with laptops and phones, staring at ugly text based tables searching for devices and checking signal strength. We wanted to deploy devices that could do the job we couldn't; to monitor the hall and its networks (or any area for that matter) 24/7 and look through the data at our leisure.

We built WiZer to do just that. WiZer allows various 'WiFi reporting nodes' (Raspberry Pi's or Intel Edison's) to send in information regarding the wireless networks in their area. WiZer can then analyze this data and perform tasks such as calculating the ideal channel for a new access point in a specific area. Furthermore, WiZer can generate clean and elegant reports on the status of rouge devices (Chromcasts, printers etc.).
